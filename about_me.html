            <p>My name is Zuhayer Alvi and I am a Computer Science student at the City College of New York. I currently reside in Queens with my loving family as I pursue my degree in Computer Science. I have always been fascinated by the power of technology to transform and improve people's lives, and this drive has led me to pursue a career as a web developer. I am currently in my 3rd year of studies, and have gained a strong foundation in computer science concepts and programming languages such as C++, Java, as well as non programming languages such as HTML and CSS. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a future web developer, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the field. I am constantly learning and seeking out opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects. I am passionate about creating clean, user-friendly websites that not only look good, but also function effectively.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing various video games of different genres and I also reading manga and watching anime. I hope you find my work interesting and I look forward to connecting with you!
